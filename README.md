## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Xuefei, a neuroscientist exploring the neural mechanisms of value processing through cutting-edge systems neuroscience techniques.

I also work as a neural data scientist, focusing on designing and quantifying complex behavioral paradigms, building large-scale neural data analysis pipelines, visualizing high-dimensional neural activity, and uncovering the latent representations of cognition in neural populations.

In most of my neuroscientific work, I primarily use MATLAB and Python. For personal projects outside of neuroscience, I enjoy working with other programming languages such as C++, Java, and more â€” building tools and applications that align with my interests and help make life more fun and a little easier.

## Project Portolio
under construction, comming soon
